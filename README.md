# GeoScan

To run suite paste command - gradle test -DtestSuite=MailRuLoginSuite.
Command-line has chosen for further implementation of CI/CD(if there will be time).
There will be two test suites MailRuLoginSuite and GeoscanApiTestSuite(Geoscan suite will not work till clarification of the issue with the test platform. Is there will be access to API or mock the server should be implemented?)

PS
The project is small, so the step layer is intentionally absent.
